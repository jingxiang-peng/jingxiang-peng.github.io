title: 04 Using genetic algorithm to solve the problem related to mosaic tile color selection
summary: This is one of the research topics within the Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Given the existence of a staggering 16,777,216 color combinations in RGB mode, a significant challenge that arises is the need to reconcile the diverse color preferences of customers with the finite supply capacity of tile manufacturers. Therefore, we developed a cosine model to measure similarity within a three-dimensional space, and conducted genetic algorithm to simulate a search for the globally optimal solution. This method not only optimizes color selection but also harmonizes the customer's needs with the supplier's capacity, enabling the most effective use of resources.
