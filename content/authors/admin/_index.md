  In the spring of 2023, owing to my exceptional performance in the China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, I was recommended for an internship as a research assistant at the Zhejiang Academy of Forestry. Prior to obtaining the bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics, I completed my undergraduate thesis concentrating on spatial-temporal analysis of high-quality development of county economy in Zhejiang Province.

  Outside of academia, I am a cycling enthusiast, I once spent 5 days to join a 360-kilometer cycling tour around Qinghai Lake at an altitude of 3,196 meters. I am also passionate about Geographical phenomena, enjoying learning them through practice, like in the journey or something.
