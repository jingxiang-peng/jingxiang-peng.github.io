title: Prediction modeling for CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of Mauna Loa
summary: This is part of the research initiatives led by the Institute of Ecological Civilization and the Institute of Carbon Neutrality at Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University. Utilizing the data set provided by David Keeling and Ralph Keeling, which contains the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> recorded at Mauna Loa for each month starting from March 1958, we divided the data into training and test datasets in an 80:20 ratio for further analysis. By introducing a periodic signal to the linear trend, we were able to establish a prediction model with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.1578 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.2102%, demonstrating the most optimal performance in predictive capacity from a statistical significance perspective. Employing this model, we have forecasted that the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at Mauna Loa will surpass 420 ppm in 2022, which is closely aligned with the current reality.
